# Convolutional Neural Networks with PyTorch

This lab revolves around the creation of a *Convolutional Neural Network*, to explore the principal techniques behind this interesting concept. To do so, we will create 2 generated datasets composed of *1 channel images* (black and white images), to classify horizontal and vertical bars (some variation is introduced in the pixels of the images using a *Bernoulli Distribution*). The first one is a *training dataset*, gathering *10 000 images* to train the neural network model (which has convolutional layers, max pooling, fully connected and linear layers), and a *validation dataset* with *1 000 images*, to eventually test the accuracy of the trained model.
